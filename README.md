## Cub3D Project

Welcome to my Cub3D project, a thrilling dive into the world of 3D game development! Inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D, this project is part of the rigorous 42 school curriculum, crafted to introduce students to the fundamentals of 3D rendering and graphics programming using C and the MiniLibX graphical library.

## Project Overview

Cub3D is all about bringing a 2D map to life with 3D projections. In this project, I've tackled:

* `Raycasting`: Building a 3D view from a 2D map, creating a realistic projection.

* `Player Movement & Interactions`: Coding smooth and responsive player controls.

* `Textures & Sprites Management`: Designing and implementing textures for walls and objects to enhance visual appeal.

* `Game Loop Implementation`: Creating a seamless game loop for real-time graphical rendering.

* `Memory Management`: Ensuring efficient memory use to keep the game running smoothly.

## Skills Developed

Through this project, I've honed my abilities in:

* `Algorithm Optimization`: Crafting efficient algorithms for real-time rendering.

* `3D Graphics Mathematics`: Applying mathematical concepts to generate 3D visuals.

* `Software Architecture`: Structuring the project for maintainability and scalability.

## Why Cub3D?
Cub3D is a notorious challenge among 42 students due to its blend of low-level C programming and the intricacies of 3D graphics. Itâ€™s an exceptional exercise in problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical prowess.
